# Python-Customer-Segmentation-Clustering

Project Description:
This project analyzes customer data from a mall and segments customers based on their demographic and spending behavior. Using Python, we conducted data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization techniques to explore the data. We performed univariate and bivariate analysis to identify potential clusters and then used the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster the customers into groups based on their similarities. We evaluated the model performance and chose the optimal number of clusters. Finally, we visualized the clusters and interpreted the results. The insights gained from this project can be used to develop targeted marketing strategies and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. This project demonstrates the power of clustering algorithms in analyzing customer data and identifying hidden patterns and insights.

# Data: 
'Mall_Customers.csv'

# Key steps involved:
- Importing the necessary libraries
- Loading the dataset into a Pandas dataframe
- Exploring the dataset and visualizing the relationships between variables
- Preprocessing the data and scaling the features
- Using K-means clustering algorithm to cluster the customers
- Evaluating the model performance and interpreting the results

# Future work:
- Implementing other clustering algorithms and comparing their performance
- Collecting more data and re-evaluating the model to improve its accuracy
